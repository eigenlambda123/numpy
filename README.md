## Why Use NumPy?

1. **Performance**: NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient compared to Python lists.
2. **Mathematical Operations**: Provides efficient support for mathematical computations, such as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
3. **Foundation for Other Libraries**: Forms the backbone of other data science libraries like pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
4. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies complex numerical operations with intuitive syntax.

## Key Features

- **Arrays**:
  - Multi-dimensional arrays (`ndarray`) with efficient indexing and slicing.

- **Mathematical Functions**:
  - Vectorized operations for element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

- **Broadcasting**:
  - Perform operations on arrays of different shapes seamlessly.

- **Linear Algebra**:
  - Support for matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, determinants, and more.

- **Random Sampling**:
  - Generate random numbers and perform probabilistic operations.

- **Integration**:
  - Works well with other scientific libraries, enabling efficient data pipelines.

## Installation

To install NumPy, use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

---

## Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(array)

# Perform operations
print(array + 5)         # Add 5 to each element
print(array.mean())      # Calculate the mean

# Create a 2D array
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(matrix)

# Perform matrix multiplication
result = np.dot(matrix, matrix)
print(result)
```

**Output**:
```
[1 2 3 4 5]
[ 6  7  8  9 10]
3.0
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
[[ 7 10]
 [15 22]]
```
